# Limitations/Todos

The code test is aimed to be completed in 1 hour. Some requirements are not fully met. However I've try my best to achieve the goal as to make to tooltip to diplay properly.

1. An arrow of tooltip shown in the screenshot is not available.
2. Lint tools are not used. But I always follow the project's setup like ESLint or others.
3. Accessibility is not available.
4. Works on IE11 and Safari on iOS 12. I don't have iOS 9 at hand.
5. When browser is resized. It would be nice to have tooltip be repositioned. 

Thanks for providing this test. It's quite fun and challenging.
